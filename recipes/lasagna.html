    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <p>You can use the microwave to reheat lasagna if you're in a pinch or short on time,
        but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles.
        The best way to reheat lasagna is in the oven.
        Simply cover the leftovers with foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour,
        or until it's heated through and the sauce is bubbly.</p>
